%Say you're replicating a previous experimenting to assess the impact of heuristic function on A* runtime.

A* is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to find the optimal path to a goal state in a graph. The choice of heuristic function can significantly impact the efficiency of A*. A well-designed heuristic function can greatly reduce the number of nodes that need to be expanded in the search process, leading to faster runtime. Previous research by Russell and Norvig (2003) has shown that solving the 8-puzzle with a heuristic based on the Manhattan distance between each tile and its goal position is more efficient than one based on the count of misplaced tiles. Here, we assess the impact of heuristic quality on A* performance by replicating Russell and Norvigâ€™s experiment and comparing the outcomes. We also examine and compare the effect of the checkerboard misplaced heuristic on the A* performance in solving the 8-puzzle.
