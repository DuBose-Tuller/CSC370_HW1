The 8-puzzle is a sliding game consisting of numbered square tiles in a 3-by-3 grid with one tile absent. We implemented the A* search algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle and assessed the impact of three different heuristic functions on search performance. The Manhattan Distance heuristic resulted in the most efficient searching. We concluded heuristics designed based on less relaxed versions of the 8-puzzle lead to more efficient A* search performance.
